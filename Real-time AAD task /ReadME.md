# Real-time AAD task

This script encompasses multiple tasks, including establishing connections between the OpenBCI board (via Brainflow) and Arduino board (through the Serial port), as well as conducting the real-time AAD task involving EEG data preprocessing and mTRF analysis.

To execute this script, you will require additional scripts located in the specified folder (e.g., Sub_Functions folder).

Furthermore, if you wish to apply Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to the correlation coefficient, utilize EMA.py and make the necessary modifications to the main script.
